# Purpose

To try and show how testing/git/frameworks can be made to work together.

There are 4 branches in this project ...

  - master 
  - 1\_typical 
  - 2\_cmake\_build
  - 3\_cmake\_google\_tests


Master has our badly coded sqrt function. The function is total rubbish... we need to built automation around it... so we can try and find the error.

To get all the phases please do a 

    git clone
